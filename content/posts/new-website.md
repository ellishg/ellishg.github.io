Back in undergrad, I created a [personal website](https://ellishg.github.io/archived-personal-website/) that featured a small list of personal projects I had at the time. I used a single `index.html` file and a simple theme I found online. I'm pretty happy with what I ended up with, given that I have little to no web development experience, but it was difficult to maintain.

I decided to create a new personal website using modern technologies and blog-style posts. This is my first such post. Let's see how it goes!

You can find the source is at [github.com/ellishg/ellishg.github.io](https://github.com/ellishg/ellishg.github.io). The owner of the [ell.is](https://ell.is/) domain was kind enough to create a redirect for me, so you can also access this site at [ell.is/hoag](https://ell.is/hoag/).

# Zola | PaperMod
I wanted a website that was simple to create/maintain, performant, and lightweight. [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) seemed to fit the bill. After an initial setup, new posts can be created simply by adding Markdown files. Zola can build minified HTML files that hopefully will load quickly and correctly on desktop and mobile browsers. And there is a large selection of themes to choose from.

I thought [PaperMod](https://github.com/cydave/zola-theme-papermod) had a clean ascetic that contained all the functionality I wanted.
